The error of the exercise 1 Finding the bug is in the function f(a,b,c,d).
We see using the Debug option in the program that for the result 2, with f(0,2,3,3) the program doesn't work.
This is because in line 11 we have the following operation:
t3 = 2 * (t0 / t1)
When we enter the values for a,b,c and d to obtain the result 2 we get that t0= t0 = a + b - g(a,0) = 1
and t1 = t1 = g(c, d) = 0. This gives us the error ZeroDivisionError.
Because we get the division 1/0 the program doesn't work.
This error happens every time the value of c is equal to the value of d in the function f.
That is way my results 1,3 and 4 are properly computed
